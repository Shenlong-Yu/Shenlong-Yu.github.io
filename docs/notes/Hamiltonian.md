The Hamiltonian is the energy that expresses [[Momentum|momentum]] and [[Position|Position]] with equal weight.
$$H \equiv \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i-L$$

> [!proof]-
> From [[Energy|Energy]] we have
$$E\equiv \sum_i \dot{q}_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} -L$$
from [[Momentum|Momentum]] we have
$$p_i=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}$$
thus we define
$$H \equiv \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i-L$$
