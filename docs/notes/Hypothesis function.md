$h_{\theta}(x)$ is called the hypothesis function. It is a function that maps the input to the predicted output using the learned parameters .

For [[Linear regression|Linear regression]], it is 
$$h_{\theta}\left( x \right)= \theta^{T}X={\theta_{0}}{x_{0}}+{\theta_{1}}{x_{1}}+{\theta_{2}}{x_{2}}+...+{\theta_{n}}{x_{n}}$$
For [[Logistic regression|Logistic regression]], it is 
$${h_\theta}\left( x \right)=\frac{1}{1+{e^{- \theta^{T}X}}}$$
