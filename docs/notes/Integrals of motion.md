During the process of [[Motion|Motion]] of a mechanical system, there exist certain functions related to the $2s$ [[Generalised coordinates|Generalised coordinates]] $q_i$ and $\dot q_i (i=1,2,...,s)$ whose values remain constant and are determined only by initial conditions. Such functions are called Integrals of [[Motion|Motion]].

Additive Integral of [[Motion|Motion]] is of profound significance, deriving from the fundamental homogeneity and isotropy of Space and time, which produces the conservation Laws and define the following concepts:
- Conservation of [[Energy|Energy]]
- Conservation of [[Momentum|Momentum]]
- Conservation of [[Angular momentum|Angular momentum]]
