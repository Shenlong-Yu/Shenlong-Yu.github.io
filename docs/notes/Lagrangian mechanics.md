Lagrangian mechanics, named after the Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is a formulation of [[Classical mechanics|Classical mechanics]] that provides an alternative approach to [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]. 

Instead of using Newton's laws of motion to describe the behavior of systems, Lagrangian mechanics uses a quantity called the [[Lagrangian|Lagrangian]], to derive the equations of motion.

The key principle behind Lagrangian mechanics is the principle of least action, known as [[Hamilton's principle|Hamilton's principle]]. According to this principle, the path taken by a system between two points in configuration space is the one for which the action integral, defined as the integral of the Lagrangian over time, is minimized.

The equations of motion in Lagrangian mechanics are derived using the [[Calculus of variations|Calculus of variations]], which involves finding the path that extremizes the action integral. These equations are known as the [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]], and they provide a concise and powerful method for analyzing the dynamics of complex systems with constraints.

Lagrangian mechanics is particularly useful in situations where the number of degrees of freedom of a system is large or when dealing with systems subject to constraints, such as those encountered in [[Classical mechanics|Classical mechanics]], celestial mechanics, continuum mechanics, and field theory. It also serves as a foundation for more advanced theories in theoretical physics, such as quantum mechanics and general relativity.
